Hi, i`m Ann Bekker!
Now i`m medical student, but hope for good luck in DE
I can program in turbo pascale, but i don`t think i can use it anywhere
First task was difficult for me, because i know nothing about DE before, i hope for interesting tasks
I think the main hobby is reading manga/manhwa, read books (the last book about maniac was very interesting), maybe sport (do some exercies, ya know)
